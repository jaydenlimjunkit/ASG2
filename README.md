# GameTron
GameTron is a website that allows users to purchase trending games for a cheaper price.

## Design Process
This website is targeted at people who play games but think that games bought from other retailers are a bit too expensive.
This website is a quick and easy way for users to be able to get trending games for cheap prices while also knowing how well received the game is.


As a user that plays a lot of games, I would find some games such as elden ring expensive. With this website I am able to get it at a cheaer price and still experience the same level of enjoyment. Our website provides detailed descriptions, reviews, and recommendations to help users make informed decisions when purchasing games.
